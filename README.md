# PIMRC_2024
This repo consists of work done for the PIMRC workshop paper


The original ResNet model presented in the paper is implemented from the paper by Shen et al.(2024), Towards Scalable and Channel-Robust Radio
 Frequency Fingerprint Identification for LoRa (paper link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02867) 
 The code can be accessed here: https://github.com/gxhen/LoRa_RFFI/tree/main/Closed_set_RFFI !
 We have just optimized the model by fine tuning the parameters. We call opt ResNet
